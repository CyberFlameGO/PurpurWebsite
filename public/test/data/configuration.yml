    description: Skips sending relative move packets for entities that didn't really
      move
    warning: The `dont-send-useless-entity-packets` option is known to cause issues
      with certain plugins installed, notably `Tab` and `Companions`
  use-alternate-keepalive:
    default: 'false'
    description: Uses a different approach to keepalive ping timeouts. Enabling this
      sends a keepalive packet once per second to a player, and only kicks for timeout
      if none of them were responded to in 30 seconds. Responding to any of them in
      any order will keep the player connected. AKA, it won't kick your players because
      1 packet gets dropped somewhere along the lines
  tps-catchup:
    default: 'false'
    description: Control tps catch-up
    note: TPS catchup makes your server tick faster than 20 TPS after any period of
      time that below 20. This is an attempt at keeping the average TPS as close to
      20 as possible, but does come with its own set of side effects
  server-mod-name:
    default: Purpur
